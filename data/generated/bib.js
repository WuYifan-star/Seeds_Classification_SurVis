        "abstract": "The agricultural sector has recognized that for crop management to thrive, acquiring relevant information on plants is needed. However, studies have shown that agricultural problems remain difficult in many parts of the world due to the lack of the necessary infrastructures. Using a public dataset of 4, 234 plant images from Aarhus University Signal Processing group in collaboration with University of Southern Denmark, that consist of descriptions under a controlled condition concerning camera radiance and stabilization. This paper uses a convolutional neural network for training and does data augmentation to identify 12 plant species using a variety of image transforms: resize, rotate, flip, scaling and histogram equalization. The trained model achieved an accuracy categorization of 99.74% during validation and 99.69% during testing, with specificities and sensitivities of 99%. In future works, we plan to utilize the model by training it to other types of plants like herbal-medicinal plants and other crops in other countries. Moreover, the proposed method can be integrated into a mobile application with the goal to provide farmers efficient farming practices.",

        "abstract": "This scientific pursuit aimed to develop a deep learning architecture tailored to classify plant seedling images. Our architecture encompasses seven learned layers - five convolutions and two fully connected. We performed full training on the network using 4, 234 plant seedling images belonging to twelve plant species from Aarhus University Signal Processing group. The system is fine-tuned for the architecture to have greater processing time and low memory consumption. The architecture was evaluated using different network parameters. Furthermore, we used training loss function, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity to evaluate the system performance. Experimental results proved that the developed architecture has reached excellent performance with overall accuracy of 90.15%. Results were achieved in 111 minutes and 36 seconds. Future work includes, first, use the model with greater amount of datasets through data augmentation and compare the results to other existing deep learning architectures using same datasets. Second, authors will consider CNN and RNN architectures together using several other plant datasets. Third, create a portable mobile application for plant seedling images classification utilizing the developed model.",

        "abstract": "Summary Efficient seed germination and establishment are important traits for field and glasshouse crops. Large-scale germination experiments are laborious and prone to observer errors, leading to the necessity for automated methods. We experimented with five crop species, including tomato, pepper, Brassica, barley, and maize, and concluded an approach for large-scale germination scoring. Here, we present the SeedGerm system, which combines cost-effective hardware and open-source software for seed germination experiments, automated seed imaging, and machine-learning based phenotypic analysis. The software can process multiple image series simultaneously and produce reliable analysis of germination- and establishment-related traits, in both comma-separated values (CSV) and processed images (PNG) formats. In this article, we describe the hardware and software design in detail. We also demonstrate that SeedGerm could match specialists\u2019 scoring of radicle emergence. Germination curves were produced based on seed-level germination timing and rates rather than a fitted curve. In particular, by scoring germination across a diverse panel of Brassica napus varieties, SeedGerm implicates a gene important in abscisic acid (ABA) signalling in seeds. We compared SeedGerm with existing methods and concluded that it could have wide utilities in large-scale seed phenotyping and testing, for both research and routine seed technology applications.",

        "abstract": "As a synergistic integration between spectroscopy and imaging technologies, spectral imaging modalities have been emerged to tackle quality evaluation dilemmas by proposing different designs with effective and practical applications in food and agriculture. With the advantage of acquiring spatio-spectral data across a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum, the state-of-the-art multispectral imaging in tandem with different multivariate chemometric analysis scenarios has been successfully implemented not only for food quality and safety control purposes, but also in dealing with critical research challenges in seed science and technology. This paper will shed some light on the fundamental configuration of the systems and give a birds-eye view of all recent approaches in the acquisition, processing and reproduction of multispectral images for various applications in seed quality assessment and seed phenotyping issues. This review article continues from where earlier review papers stopped but it only focused on fully-operated multispectral imaging systems for quality assessment of different sorts of seeds. Thence, the review comprehensively highlights research attempts devoted to real implementations of only fully-operated multispectral imaging systems and does not consider those ones that just utilized some key wavelengths extracted from hyperspectral data analyses without building independent multispectral imaging systems. This makes this article the first attempt in briefing all published papers in multispectral imaging applications in seed phenotyping and quality monitoring by providing some examples and research results in characterizing physicochemical quality traits, predicting physiological parameters, detection of defect, pest infestation and seed health.",

        "abstract": "Automated classification of seed varieties is of paramount importance for seed producers to maintain the purity of a variety and crop yield. Traditional approaches based on computer vision and simple feature extraction could not guarantee high accuracy classification. This paper presents a new approach using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) as a generic feature extractor. The extracted features were classified with artificial neural network (ANN), cubic support vector machine (SVM), quadratic SVM, weighted k-nearest-neighbor (kNN), boosted tree, bagged tree, and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Models trained with CNN-extracted features demonstrated better classification accuracy of corn seed varieties than models based on only simple features. The CNN-ANN classifier showed the best performance, classifying 2250 test instances in 26.8\u00a0s with classification accuracy 98.1%, precision 98.2%, recall 98.1%, and F1-score 98.1%. This study demonstrates that the CNN-ANN classifier is an efficient tool for the intelligent classification of different corn seed varieties.",

        "abstract": "Optical sensors combined with machine learning algorithms have led to significant advances in seed science. These advances have facilitated the development of robust approaches, providing decision-making support in the seed industry related to the marketing of seed lots. In this study, a novel approach for seed quality classification is presented. We developed classifier models using Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy and X-ray imaging techniques to predict seed germination and vigor. A forage grass (Urochloa brizantha) was used as a model species. FT-NIR spectroscopy data and radiographic images were obtained from individual seeds, and the models were created based on the following algorithms: linear discriminant analysis (LDA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), random forest (RF), naive Bayes (NB), and support vector machine with radial basis (SVM-r) kernel. In the germination prediction, the models individually reached an accuracy of 82% using FT-NIR data, and 90% using X-ray data. For seed vigor, the models achieved 61% and 68% accuracy using FT-NIR and X-ray data, respectively. Combining the FT-NIR and X-ray data, the performance of the classification model reached an accuracy of 85% to predict germination, and 62% for seed vigor. Overall, the models developed using both NIR spectra and X-ray imaging data in machine learning algorithms are efficient in quickly, non-destructively, and accurately identifying the capacity of seed to germinate. The use of X-ray data and the LDA algorithm showed great potential to be used as a viable alternative to assist in the quality classification of U. brizantha seeds.",

        "abstract": "Efficient seed quality assessment methodologies are important for the seed industry. Advanced seed technology research requires the use of high productivity methods that provide detailed information on seed structural integrity and predict its physiological potential quickly and accurately. The aim of this study was to propose a method for predicting germination capacity and discriminate Jatropha curcas L. seeds regarding germination speed and seedling vigor by combining automatic X-ray analysis and machine learning model. The study was performed using automated analysis of radiographic images of seeds, obtaining a series of morphological and tissue integrity descriptors. After the X-ray test, the seeds were submitted to physiological assessments. Based on all individual seed descriptors, quality classes were created and LDA models were applied. Prediction of seed viability, germination speed and seedling vigor resulted in an average of 94.36, 83.72 and 89.72% of correctly classified seeds, respectively. High throughput X-ray image analysis can provide information needed to discriminate individual Jatropha curcas seeds into different classes of quality, i.e., germination capacity, germination speed and seedling vigor. The methodology proposed can be used to discriminate between seed classes quickly and robustly.",

This study investigates the morphological characteristics of naturally aged muskmelon seed in relation to germination ability. An X-ray microCT scanner was employed to generate CT images and then several image processing techniques such as re-slicing, contrast enhancement, noise reduction, and segmentation were performed on the images. Afterwards, fifteen preprocessed images were nominated from each sample, and features of interest (i.e., local binary pattern, Gabor, local Fourier (FFT), texture, contrast and Haralick textural (Tx) features) were extracted. The sequential forward selection (SFS) method was applied as a search strategy to identify the most relevant features using a variety of different objective functions. It was determined that the Fisher discriminant objective function performed the best. A germination test was performed to evaluate the seed viability and the information was used to construct the training and validation data set. The seeds were divided into 2 groups: viable (group-1) and non-viable (group-0). Different classifiers were probed to determine the optimal performer, where the linear discriminant classifier resulted in an accuracy of 98.9%, with 10-fold cross-validation using eighteen selected features.

        "abstract": "The internal structure of a seed plays a vital role during germination. Hence, before planting the seed internal quality inspection is advantageous to produce healthy seedlings. In this study, an X-ray CT scanner was used to generate CT images of five-year-old naturally aged pepper seeds. Several processing techniques such as reslicing, feature extraction, and classification were performed on these images. The reslicing process was applied to construct three different planes, namely, transaxial, sagittal, and coronal plane images from raw CT images. Then, three images were selected from each sample (one from each plane) for feature extraction. Using a pattern recognition algorithm, the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) was created for each image, and twenty-two types of statistical derivations were performed to generate GLCM textural features. A supervised data matrix was constructed based on the germination results of the seed samples from the images, where the seeds were divided into two classes: normal viable seeds (class-1) and nonviable & abnormal viable seeds (class-2). Supervised classification methods, such as partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), support vector machine (SVM), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) were used to evaluate the best outcome. Among the tested classifiers, PLS-DA provided the highest accuracy of 88.7% with five-fold cross validation, where seven important features extracted from different angles (\u03b8) were found from the beta coefficient to be significant in the classification of the seed. Results from this study show that X-ray CT imaging incorporated with a pattern recognition system is a robust technique to classify seeds based on their internal quality attributes.",
